      "# Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Here at [URX](http://urx.com/) we've built the [world's first deep link search API](https://developers.urx.com/). Developers who integrate our API can monetize their apps or websites with deep links to contextually relevant actions in other apps. To ensure the content we surface on publisher sites and applications is relevant, we've built a search engine on top of a large web corpus. Publisher pages are used as search queries to discover the most relevant third party documents to surface from within our corpus. This corpus of web documents has been meticulously maintained and carefully grown by crawling internet content. We've come to discover that building a functional crawler can be done relatively cheaply, but building a robust crawler requires overcoming a few technical challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is part 3 in our series \"The Science of Crawl\" addressing the technical challenges around growing and maintaining a web corpus. In [Part 1](http://blog.urx.com/urx-blog/2014/9/4/the-science-of-crawl-part-1-deduplication-of-web-content), we introduced a funnel for deduplicating web documents within a search index. The dual problems of exact-duplicate and near-duplicate web document identification are considered. By chaining together several methods with increasing specificity we identify a system that provides sufficient precision and recall with minimal computational trade-offs. In [Part 2](http://blog.urx.com/urx-blog/2014/10/23/the-science-of-crawl-part-2-content-freshness) we visit the problem of balancing resource allocation between crawling new pages and revisiting stale ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this post, we look at the challenge of __prioritizing__ which web documents to capture first. To ensure our search engine contains relevant results for our publishers, we need a crawler which continuously discovers new content. To provide new content into the search engine, a persistent web crawler extracts previously unseen links within pages and adds the links onto a priority queue. The new link is then popped from the queue and subsequently traversed. The resulting content is downloaded and indexed into the search engine. \n",
      "\n",
      "Naively, links in the queue could be ordered temporally, based on the classic First-In-First-Out (FIFO) paradigm. However, given the scale at which URX crawls web content, there are hundreds of millions of uncrawled links queueing at any given time. Given such large volume there is likely to be important documents arbitrarily distributed across the queue, uncorrelated with temporal ordering. There is a need to assess the potential value of a link even before pushing it to the queue. \n",
      "\n",
      "Research within the field of prioritization can be broken into two areas: __query relevance__ and __query-independent importance__. Query relevance refers to biasing a crawler to download content \"most relevant\" to the content actively searched. Query independent importance refers to leveraging the graph structure of web links to encourage an \"importance\" based prioritization. There are tradeoffs to both. For query relevance methods, it is difficult to evaluate the correlation between unseen links and search intents. The only information available is often the link itself and surrounding anchor text. On the other hand, query-independent methods typically represent the web as a graph structure, where vertices are web pages and edges are links. This formulation yields a natural interpretation of importance as connectivity within the graph. However, crawling new pages using graph-based importance may not necessarily correlate with improvement in overall user experience. Ultimately, a solution which combines and balances both methodologies may yield higher accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Query-independent importance\n",
      "\n",
      "The first facet of prioritization estimates page importance independent of user search queries. By representing the web as a large graph, classic methods can be used to discover important nodes. Larry Page's famous [pagerank](http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/422/1/1999-66.pdf) is perhaps the most popular method for estimating the importance of pages. The method seeks to solve the iterative equation (taken from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank))\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\n",
      "PR(u) = \\sum_{v\\in B_u}{\\frac{PR(v)}{L(v)}}\n",
      "$$\n",
      "\n",
      "where $PR(u)$ is the relative rank of a page $u$, $B_u$ is the set of all pages pointing to $u$, and $L(v)$ is the number of out-links in page $v$. \n",
      "\n",
      "At a high level, a page is important if: 1) many pages point into it and 2) the incoming pages are themselves, important. The PageRank problem is well studied. It was discovered that solutions of this iterative system are degenerate - often converging to the page with highest rank. To fix this issue, [Page and Brin](http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf) added a small connection weight between all pairs of pages to create a more stable system. This is realized by adding a damping factor $d$ normalized by the number of pages $N$ to the above equation:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\n",
      "PR(u) = \\frac{1-d}{N} + d\\sum_{v\\in B_u}{\\frac{PR(v)}{L(v)}}\n",

      "# Query relevant prioritization\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of a query-based prioritization scheme is to rank unseen links in the priority queue as a function of relevance to incoming search queries. One specific implementation is diagrammed below, taken from Figure 4 from [Olston's recent paper](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~spandey/wsdm-pandey.pdf).\n",
      "<img src=\"queryflow.png\" />\n",
      "\n",
      "At a high level, Olston's goal is to identify \"needy\" queries - i.e., queries whose top K-results do not contain relevant results. The *type* of content needed to improve these queries is identified and used to prioritize uncrawled links likely to contain such needed content. Using this methodology, underperforming queries are continuously supplied with new content.\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve this, the first step is to build an index of \"needy\" queries; those queries that stand to benefit the most from new, diverse content. In the definition of Olston, a search query is needy if the average relevancy score returned in the top-K results is less than a predefined threshold. Defining search relevancy is a subtle topic deserving of its own blog post. I recommend [Buettcher's book](http://www.amazon.com/Information-Retrieval-Implementing-Evaluating-Engines/dp/0262026511/) on Information Retrieval for a full history and quantification of search relevancy. In short, relevancy is commonly calculated as a function of number of returned documents, [BM-25 scoring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25) and click through rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given an index of needy queries, a function can be constructed to measure the priority of a given uncrawled page, $p$. Olston writes this function as:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\n",
      "P(p, Q) = \\sum_{q\\in Q} f(q) * I(p, q)\n",
      "$$\n",
      "\n",
      "Where \n",
      "```\n",
      "Q is the index of needy queries\n",
      "f(q) is the frequency of a given query\n",
      "I(p, q) is an indicator of whether an unseen page, p, matches query, q\n",
      "```\n",
      "Pages matching needy, frequently searched queries will have the largest prioritization scores. Similarly pages which are either infrequently searched or contain rich results will be de-prioritized.\n",
      "\n",
      "To measure $I(p, q)$, Olston describes an interesting, approach which seeks to jointly maximize the expected priority across all unseen pages and queries. Unfortunately in the worst case, this full expectation maximization is NP hard. To reduce complexity, Olston suggests [w-shingling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W-shingling) pages and queries. If the w-shingles of the query and page match $\\rho$ fraction of shingles, $I(p, q)$ will be 1. Otherwise $I(p, q)$ will be 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "There exists a catch-22. If a page has not yet been crawled, its content is unknown. However, the decision to crawl a page is biased by the content of a page. To approximate a solution, Olston describes an uncrawled \"page\" as the tokens generated from a uncrawled URL along with any surrounding anchor text. For example, in [the following article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/arts/television/trevor-noah-to-succeed-jon-stewart-on-the-daily-show.html) from The New York Times, we see a link:\n",
